      <p>Hi there! I'm a computer science student and well rounded software guy based in Burnaby BC. I specialize in front-end web development, but I like to dip my hand into many different pies.</p>
      <p>I'm always looking for cool projects to work on and great people to work with. If you think I'd be a good fit for your team, feel free to shoot me a message via any of the links below. Looking forward to adding a little magic to your reality</p>
